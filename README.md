# CoDrone Movement Tracking System

What started out as a side project became an important module that I soon found very interesting. Wanting to create a camera based module that tracks movements, I got out many tutorials and learned many things to master this skill. The subject soon bloomed into many different projects, this one included. For the module I am showing you now, I combined movement tracking with drones(The class I was taking back then), and created a module where I controlled the drone using body movements.

## Startoff:

Firstly, I started off with a basic camera module,(which basically just activated my camera) and from there I officially started! I began researching pose landmark detection guides, and found one with the exact name(Coincidence??)! It was a Google site collaborating with OpenCV, a visual and pose detecting library(which frankly, I only used for vision!) in which they made the pose landmark detection system I used as part of my code!
